	<t size='1.25' font='PuristaLight'>Multiplayer</t><br />
	Fixed some issues with COOP and added possibility to play PvP.<br />
	<br />
	<t size='1.25' font='PuristaLight'>New squad spawn mode</t><br />
	The spawning system was reworked to spawn reinforcements near their squad if there's no enemy nearby and to reuse existing groups. This should make the game more tactical and less chaotic but it's a bit unrealistic. You can turn off this feature in Advanced Settings.<br />
	<br />	
	<t size='1.25' font='PuristaLight'>New supports: Vehicle ammo, Infantry ammo and Arsenal</t><br />
	You can now call in a vehicle ammo drop, an infantry ammo drop and an arsenal. Arsenal will allow you to pick any equipment you want.<br />
	<br />
	<t size='1.25' font='PuristaLight'>Improved vehicle shop</t><br />
	Player can now choose vehicle seat and skin when buying a new vehicle. Players can also buy AI vehicles as a support.<br />
	<br /> 
	<t size='1.25' font='PuristaLight'>Ingame configuration changes</t><br />
	You can now change some game options even after the start. Settings are accessible through shop dialog or death.<br />
	<br />
	<t size='1.25' font='PuristaLight'>New configuration options</t><br />
	You can now select a mission date in the configuration and vehicle prices can now be globally adjusted by a multiplier. You can also restrict number of AI air vehicles.<br />
	<br />
