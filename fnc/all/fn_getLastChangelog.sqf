	<t size='1.2'>New squad spawn mode</t><br />
	The spawning system was reworked to spawn reinforcements near their squad if there's no enemy nearby and to reuse existing groups. This should make the game more tactical and less chaotic but it's a bit unrealistic. You can turn off this feature in Advanced Settings.<br />
	<br />
	<t size='1.2'>TODO: In-game settings</t><br />
	You can now change some mission settings while playing. Every player can now also adjust their personal settings (such as controls and UI) at any time.<br />
	<br />
	<t size='1.2'>TODO: New supports: Vehicle ammo, Infantry ammo and Arsenal</t><br />
	You can now call in a vehicle ammo drop, an infantry ammo drop and an arsenal. Arsenal will allow you to pick any equipment you want.<br />
	<br />
	<t size='1.2'>TOOD: COOP improvements</t><br />
	Fixed some multiplayer issues, players can now pick a side and change their personal settings in-game.
	<t size='1.2'>TODO: New maps</t><br />
