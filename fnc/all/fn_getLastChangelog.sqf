	<t size='1.25' font='PuristaLight'>New squad spawn mode</t><br />
	The spawning system was reworked to spawn reinforcements near their squad if there's no enemy nearby and to reuse existing groups. This should make the game more tactical and less chaotic but it's a bit unrealistic. You can turn off this feature in Advanced Settings.<br />
	<br />	
	<t size='1.25' font='PuristaLight'>New supports: Vehicle ammo, Infantry ammo and Arsenal</t><br />
	You can now call in a vehicle ammo drop, an infantry ammo drop and an arsenal. Arsenal will allow you to pick any equipment you want.<br />
	<br />
	<t size='1.25' font='PuristaLight'>Improved vehicle shop</t><br />
	Player can now choose vehicle seat and skin when buying a new vehicle. Players can also buy AI vehicles as a support.<br />
	<br /> 
	<t size='1.25' font='PuristaLight'>Improved UI</t><br />

	<br />
	<t size='1.25' font='PuristaLight'>New configuration options</t><br />
