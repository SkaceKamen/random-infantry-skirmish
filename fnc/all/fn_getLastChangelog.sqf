	<t size='1.25' font='PuristaLight'>New squad spawn mode</t><br />
	The spawning system was reworked to spawn reinforcements near their squad if there's no enemy nearby and to reuse existing groups. This should make the game more tactical and less chaotic but it's a bit unrealistic. You can turn off this feature in Advanced Settings.<br />
